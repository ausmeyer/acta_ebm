# Motivating EBM was a WBA

---

## WBAs as a Bridge Between Theory and Practice

- Traditional classroom-based EBM teaching often fails to translate into clinical skills.
- WBAs enable students to **apply EBM** in real-time, working with actual patients.
- Integration of EBM into WBAs provides a **continuous learning process**, improving knowledge retention and clinical decision-making. 

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: Coomarasamy & Khan (2004): *What is the evidence that postgraduate teaching in
evidence based medicine changes anything?*

---

## Utilizing Case-Based Learning to Apply EBM

- **Benefits:**
  - Enhances critical thinking and decision-making skills.
  - Bridges the gap between theory and clinical practice.
  - Fosters teamwork and communication among learners.
- Case-based learning significantly improves EBM knowledge and application. 

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: Young T, Rohwer A, Volmink J, Clarke M. *What are the effects of teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC)? Overview of systematic reviews.*

---

## Benefits of Clinical Integration of EBM through WBAs

- **Increases clinical relevance**: Students apply PICO questions directly related to patient care.
- **Improves retention**: WBAs reinforce the application of EBM principles in real clinical scenarios, improving retention compared to standalone methods.
- **Enhances behavior**: Clinically integrated WBAs lead to better behavior change, such as literature review habits and evidence application.

- **Reference**: Coomarasamy & Khan (2004): *What is the evidence that postgraduate teaching in
evidence based medicine changes anything?*

---

## Essential Components of EBM in WBAs

- **Problem Formulation**: Students develop clinically relevant PICO questions during rounds.
- **Critical Appraisal**: Students assess literature for relevance and validity directly in patient care scenarios.
- **Application**: EBM findings are immediately applied to patient management, bridging theory and practice.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: Kasai et al. (2024): *Effect of a workplace-based learning program on clerkship students’ behaviors and attitudes toward evidence-based medicine practice.*

---

## Structured Feedback and Reflection in WBAs

- **Structured Feedback**: Feedback on EBM presentations helps students refine their skills and improve their understanding of clinical applicability.
- **Reflection**: Encouraging students to reflect on their EBM processes reinforces continuous learning and helps integrate evidence into future patient care.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: Kasai et al. (2024): *Effect of a workplace-based learning program on clerkship students’ behaviors and attitudes toward evidence-based medicine practice.*

## Challenges in Implementing EBM as a WBA

- **Time Constraints**: Faculty often struggle to integrate EBM teaching into busy clinical schedules.
- **Varying Student (and faculty) Preparedness**: Differences in prior EBM knowledge can impact the effectiveness.
- **Sustaining Long-Term Behavior Change**: EBM behavior may diminish over time without continuous reinforcement.

---

## Students’ Perspective on EBM Teaching in WBAs

- **Positive Reception**: A systematic review found that students generally have a positive perception of learning EBM through practical applications.
- **Increased Engagement**: WBAs make EBM more engaging as students actively formulate clinical questions and apply evidence to real patients.
- **Improved Skills**: Evidence shows improved critical thinking and decision-making skills when students are assessed via WBAs that integrate EBM principles.

# Enhancing the Quality of Medical Students' EBM Presentations

--- 

## Importance of Asking Answerable Questions

- **EBM Foundation**: The first step in EBM is formulating clear, answerable clinical questions using the PICO framework (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).
- **Types of Questions**: 
  - Background: General knowledge about a condition or intervention.
  - Foreground: Specific knowledge to inform clinical decisions (PICO format).

- Example:
  - P: Patient with hypertension, I: Lifestyle changes, C: Medication, O: Blood pressure reduction.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM*: Asking answerable questions is a crucial skill in EBM (Chapter 1).

---

## Teaching Strategies for Asking Better Questions

- **Role Modeling**: Faculty should demonstrate the process of turning clinical uncertainty into answerable questions during rounds.
- **Interactive Methods**: Group activities where students formulate and refine clinical questions with peer and mentor feedback.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM* (Chapter 1): Role modeling and interactive teaching enhance question formulation skills.

---

## Acquiring the Best Evidence for EBM

- **Key Resources**: Teach students how to efficiently use preappraised sources (e.g., Cochrane, UpToDate) for quick evidence retrieval.
- **Search Strategies**: Focus on systematic and strategic search techniques (e.g., using Boolean operators, medical subject headings (MeSH)) to find relevant studies.
- **Understanding Study Hierarchy**: Would prefer studies with inherently lower risk of bias.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM* (Chapter 2): Effective use of evidence sources is critical to successful EBM presentations.

## Appraising Evidence: Levels of Evidence

```{r evidence_pyramid, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

# Define levels of evidence
levels <- c("Systematic Reviews", 
            "Randomized Controlled Trials", 
            "Cohort Studies", 
            "Case-Control Studies", 
            "Expert Opinion")

# Create a data frame for the pyramid
df <- data.frame(
  Level = factor(levels, levels = rev(levels)),
  Value = 5:1,
  ymin = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 0),
  ymax = c(4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5)
)

# Define a custom color palette (from darker to lighter blue)
blue_palette <- rev(c("#4A97D5", "#6FAEE0", "#94C5EA", "#B9DCF5", "#E6F3FF"))

# Create the pyramid plot
ggplot(df, aes(xmin = 0, xmax = Value, ymin = ymin-2, ymax = ymax+2, fill = Level)) +
  geom_rect() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = blue_palette) +  # Use custom color palette
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:5, labels = NULL, expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 5), labels = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = Value - 0.5, y = (ymin + ymax) / 2, label = Level),
    hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, size = 5, color = "black"
  )
```

## Teaching the Evidence Search Process

- **Educational Prescriptions**: Assign students clinical questions and guide them through the search process to find answers.
- **Practical Exercises**: Incorporate case-based learning where students are required to locate and appraise evidence for their cases.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM* (Chapter 2): Effective teaching involves guiding students through the evidence search process.

---

## Appraising Evidence for EBM Presentations

- **Critical Appraisal**: Teach students how to evaluate the validity, relevance, and applicability of research.
- **Key Appraisal Criteria**:
  - **Study Design**: experimental vs. observational studies.
  - **Bias Assessment**: How to detect selection bias, performance bias, and publication bias.
  - **Strength of Evidence**: Use established tools like GRADE to assess evidence quality.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM* (Chapter 3): Critical appraisal is essential for applying evidence effectively.

## Enhancing Students’ Appraisal Skills

- **Group Appraisal Sessions**: Encourage group discussions and collaborative appraisal to improve skills.
- **Use of Checklists**: Introduce students to critical appraisal checklists (e.g., CASP, CONSORT) to structure their evaluations.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
- **Reference**: *How to Practice and Teach EBM* (Chapter 3): Collaborative appraisal improves students’ understanding and application of evidence.

# Evaluation and Feedback for EBM Presentations

---

## Structured Feedback in EBM Presentations
- **Pendleton’s Rules**:
  - **Self-Assessment**: The learner reflects on their performance.
  - **Positive Feedback**: Supervisor provides specific, positive remarks on strengths.
  - **Constructive Feedback**: Areas for improvement are identified.
  - **Action Plan**: The learner outlines steps for improvement.

- **Benefits**:
  - Promotes reflection and continuous learning.
  - Ensures feedback is balanced, constructive, and actionable.
